# cpanfiles
A collection of additional cpanfiles that have no natural home with any project

## Creating a cpanfile

1. Hit the _Create new file_ button top right
2. Create a sub-directory named appropriately (writing a filename and adding a `/` will create subdirectories)
3. Write the cpanfile out and commit
